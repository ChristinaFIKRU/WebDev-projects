# Kitfo (Ethiopian Spiced Steak Tartare)

Kitfo is a beloved Ethiopian dish made with finely minced beef, seasoned with spiced butter and chili. Rich, bold, and deeply cultural—often enjoyed on special occasions or with loved ones.

## Ingredients

- 1 lb very fresh beef (sirloin or tenderloin), finely minced

- 1/4 cup niter kibbeh (Ethiopian spiced clarified butter)

- 1–2 tablespoons mitmita (Ethiopian chili spice, adjust to taste)

- 1/2 teaspoon salt (or to taste)

- 1/4 teaspoon ground cardamom (korarima)

- A pinch of freshly ground black pepper

- For Serving (Optional but Traditional)

- Injera

- Gomen kitfo (lightly sautéed collard greens)

- Ayib (Ethiopian fresh cheese)

## Instructions

1. Ensure the beef is extremely fresh. Trim off any fat and finely mince it using a sharp knife.

2. Gently warm the niter kibbeh over low heat until just melted—do not let it boil.

3. In a bowl, combine the minced beef, mitmita, salt, and optional spices.

4. Pour the warm niter kibbeh over the meat and gently mix by hand until evenly coated.

5. Taste and adjust seasoning carefully.

6. Serve immediately, traditionally at room temperature or slightly warmed (not cooked).

## Tips

- Kitfo can be served tere (raw), leb leb (slightly warmed), or yebesele (fully cooked), depending on preference.

- Always source your meat from a trusted butcher if serving raw.

- Eating kitfo with injera using your hands is part of the experience 🤍
